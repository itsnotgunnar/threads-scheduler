* SchedulerTest05
*
* Test verifies the time slicing functions by going through the following 
* logic:
*    spawn four children 
*    each child delays in a busy wait and then exits
*    child with a name that ends in a number divisible by 4 dumps the process table
*
* A loop of this logic is repeated 3 times.The proc table should show non-zero values 
* for CPU time for each of the children since their delays are larger than the 
* timeslice.
